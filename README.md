# Overview

### Project Overview

Michigan State University \(MSU\) and Brown University \(Brown\) use AppTree's Enterprise UX platform for connecting to a variety of  applications and data sources for the delivery of features to their users using AppTree's mobile UX clients.

MSU and Brown have selected Planon as their IWMS.

AppTree is a workflow driven platform used for connecting enterprise systems and data, and delivering features and information to end-users through any supported user experience.

{% hint style="info" %}
AppTree user experiences include mobile apps, web apps, sms/text message apps, chat channels and chat bots, and voice enabled devices.
{% endhint %}

MSU and Brown use AppTree's Mobile UX clients.

AppTree's Mobile UX clients have capabilities that are inherited by any application that runs on the clients. MSU and Brown want to continue to leverage these benefits with Planon:

* Comprehensive off-line user experience
* Native cross platform clients for iOS & Android
* Extensible & configurable architecture
* Integration with other campus systems and data sources
* Integration with existing SSO
* Enterprise app security

The goal of the project is for MSU and Brown to preserve their existing user experience and features by connecting AppTree to Planon.
