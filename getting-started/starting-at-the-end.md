# Starting at the End

### Why did we create API documentation for APIs that don't exist?

Normally, you would expect to receive this documentation only after APIs are built.  We have produced them before anything has been built or delivered.

AppTree has found that using '_aspirational_' API documentation is the best way to come to to an agreement about how an existing enterprise application like Planon will communicate with AppTree workflows.

The API documentation describes, in full detail, how each API will be called, what parameters it accepts and the exact contents of the response to the API.  This results in the following benefits:

* By all parties agreeing on the features, and the engineers agreeing on the specifics of the APIs, we have a guarantee that we are in 100% lock-step on the structure of the services required to meet all requirements.
* By agreeing on the API parameters and response, the workflows that run on the AppTree platform can be developed, tested and delivered _before_ all the APIs are ready. 

AppTree Software has a mission of "making enterprise software easier".  There are many reasons why enterprise software is "hard" and therefore the solution to this has many parts.  One big part of what makes it hard is the staggered delivery of features \(aka "the roadmap"\) resulting in a lot of waiting for required functionality.

By creating API documentation, and coming to an agreement on what the end-result will look like, AppTree can generate 'mock' versions of all APIs that respond like the real versions will respond once they are delivered.  These can be used to develop the final workflows, connect them to the desired finalized user experience and put 'real' apps in our customers hands, that have been fully tested.

As the real APIs are released, you can swap them in for the mock versions and re-test the apps.  We've found this makes it much easier to get quality user experiences delivered earlier in the project.
