# Purpose of this Document

### Purpose of this Document

This living document should be considered a '_beta_' or '_draft_' document for the duration of the project.  We will be updating it as we progress towards meeting the shared objectives. 

The purpose of the document is to facilitate the following results:

1. Collaboration, which requires open and transparent communication
2. Validation of project assumptions & objectives
3. Reconciliation of any differences in expected features 
4. Documentation of the APIs needed to meet expectations

The main message we want to highlight is that all the project participants should read this document carefully and call out anything that is missing, incorrect or needs clarification.

The central component of this is the API Documentation found later in this document.

{% hint style="info" %}
The API documentation is a _**discussion**_.  The purpose is to communicate the APIs needed to deliver the required features, not to dictate exactly how the APIs will function.
{% endhint %}

The API documentation is in the OpenAPI Specification format for RESTful web services.  This is better know as 'swagger docs'.  This documentation is useful to a software developer for the purpose of integrating with an existing system.
