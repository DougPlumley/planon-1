# Time Entry APIs

### Time Entry & Approval 

The labor related services allow for creating a time entry, updating a time entry, deleting a time entry, and getting a collection of time entries or a single time entry based on ID.  The ability to bulk update a collection of time entries is also provided.  This bulk update may be requested by the user who is submitting their daily labor entries for supervisor approval, or by a supervisor who is reviewing employee labor entries to approve or reject.
