# Project APIs

### Projects \(Non-Capital\)

The project services allow for creating, updating, and getting a collection of projects or a single project based on ID.  Projects may not be deleted.  The services are focused on non-capital projects.  When a project is created, it may or may not have project phases at the time of creation.  The services allow for the creation of project phases which relate to a work order that will be assigned to a crew or person to perform the work in that phase.  These project phases can also be updated, which may include updates to the project description of work to be performed, status, or attributes that may also need to reflected on the corresponding work order.
