# Material APIs

### Material Request and Issue 

Work order parts can be obtained by a material request which will be routed to the warehouse for issuance, or can be obtained by direct issuance.  The material related services allow for creating and updating a part request or issuance.  The ability to get a collection of part requests, or a single part request or material issue by ID is provided.  A part request can be updated and converted into a material issue when the warehouse issues the requested parts.  The material request and issue services do not allow for delete.
