# Purchase Req APIs

### Purchase Requisition 

The purchase requisition services allow for creating, updating, and getting a collection of requisitions or a single requisition based on ID.  Purchase requisitions may not be deleted.  When updating a purchase requisition, this may involve converting it to a purchase order.
