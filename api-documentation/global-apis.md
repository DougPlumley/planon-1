# Global APIs

### General Use APIs 

Additional services will be used globally which include the ability to select data used by other APIs.  These include status, work order detail attributes, user defined fields, account billing data, notes, document attachments, and more.  Many of these services only allow the ability to get data, not create or update, because for those services it is not necessary to update the data by the mobile application.  An example of this is a status service which is intended to get a list of statuses, but not create a new status or update an existing status.

In addition to the list or lookup services needed, the ability to create/update/fetch assets, create/update/fetch asset rentals, and create/update/fetch contact information has been included in these global APIs.
